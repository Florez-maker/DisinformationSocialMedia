            <h2 style="text-align:center">Introduction and Statement of the Problem</h2>
            <h3> The internet has its starting point in the 60s but at that time its use was destined to the arms race of the Cold War, the race for space, the banking system and sciences and universities.<br><br>
            However, the Internet did not have a significant impact on the broad masses until the creation of the first practical computer systems and the new generations of personal computers, which allowed access to the internet for anyone.<br><br>
            Saying any person is the same as referring to any user. But, yes. The internet has been a great tool for hyperconnection and globalization between people. However, it is a tool that largely dehumanizes humanity by reducing interactions to user stuff.<br><br>
            Although it may not seem like it, one of the main purposes of social networks created at the end of the 90s, was not only to connect people and their experiences, but also to reduce connections under anonymity. But, the problem came when the networks did not solve that problem, rather they increased it and gave it more dynamism.<br><br>
            Okay, is clear that the anonymity is a big problem, but it isn´t necessary to be anonymous to fall into another of the great problems of contemporaneity that cusiously at the beginning of social networks was not the norm and currently seems to be a constant: the disinformation.<br><br>
            The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact that social networks have had on public opinion and its consequences, good and bad. A social networks that not only presents both anonymous users and verified subjects, but these may be interacting in a way that is negative for the construction of an objective and informed public opinion. <br><br>
            Firstly, the incidence of information dissemination through networks and how it affects public opinion will be analyzed.<br><br>
            This will be done by a brave documentary review comment and the data collected by a survey done on a small scale. In a second point, solutions will be shared to work in the fight against disinformation, on how to detect fake news and cultivate a digital or media literacy.<br><br> 
            At the end, a short explanatory video will be presented to flow and better understand the easy verifications that any user and person can do to spot fake news.<br><br>

            <h3>We have decided to carry out a survey to carry out a study on what people think about misinformation on social networks.</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Introduction and Statement of the Problem</h2>
            <h3> The Internet has its starting point in the 60s with the objective to contribute with the arms race of the Cold War against de Soviet Union in which the race for space, the banking system and sciences and universities were the priorities.<br><br>
            However, the Internet did not have a significant impact on the broad masses until the creation of the first practical computer systems and the new generations of personal computers, which allowed access to the it for anyone.<br><br>
            In that way, the Internet has been a great tool for hyper connection between people, communication, research, and investigation, which has facilitating globalization in last decades. Unfortunately, the advantages were obscured by the mismanagement of it that dehumanizes humanity by reducing interactions to user stuff.<br> <br>
            Although it may not seem like it, one of the main purposes of social networks created at the end of the 90s, was not only about to connect people and their experiences, but also to reduce connections under anonymity. The problem came when the networks did not solve that problem, rather they increased it and gave it more dynamism.<br> <br>
            Is clear that the anonymity is a big problem, but it isn´t necessary to be anonymous to fall into another of the great problems of contemporaneity, the disinformation.  Curiously, at the beginning of social networks was not a source of disinformation but through time with the increasing amount of people and information identify false from real information has become complex.<br> <br>
            The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact that social networks have had on public opinion and its consequences. A social network that not only presents both anonymous users and verified subjects, but these may be interacting in a way that is negative for the construction of an objective and informed public opinion.<br> <br>
            Firstly, the incidence of information dissemination through networks and how it affects public opinion will be analyzed. This will be done by a brief documentary review comment and the data collected by a survey done on a small scale. Secondly, solutions will be shared to work in the fight against disinformation, on how to detect fake news and cultivate a digital or media literacy. Lastly, a short explanatory video will be presented to understand  better the ways of verifications that any user and person can do to spot fake news.<br> <br>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Status of the issue</h2>
            <h3> The internet is not a means of communication in itself. It is the metaspace in network where to enter you must first establish a connection, and as long as you are connected, it is possible to surf the net in a sea of possibilities, tools, knowledge, relationships, etc. Interestingly, humans have always sought to create faster and more efficient communication networks. For the romans and the incas, having consolidated themselves as empires on both continents, their leaders understood the need for communication and its immediacy for the strength of their society. That is why in different periods of time, both cultures and societies shared the same communication network: the chains of runners, who had to undertake a path to deliver important correspondence (sometimes they were killed for this work). From the Silk Road to transatlantic trips made on ships that, among other things, transported courier from Europe to the New World. Even until the middle of the twentieth century the transport of messengers and various news was through material means such as trains or ships. Which wasn't exactly immediate. The messaging had the real need to become more instantaneous due to the influence that the logic of a warrior had in the two World Wars. <br><br>
            The birth of the internet has already been mentioned, but the impact it has had on society, its development and its effect that catapulted a total globalization (started in 1492) began in the 90's. In that period, Internet connectivity became more widespread in the world and countries, and various platforms created on the Internet saw in this metaspacel tool the possibility of carrying dot .com business models. Many internet domains have been created for this purpose. Although for the interest of this essay, social networks are part of the new technologies of mass use and communication, that contribute to the demonstration of our purpose. <br><br>
            It is said that the entry of the internet into world culture not only meant a third industrial revolution but has shaped a new kind of moment for humanity, the Digital Age. A new temporality, with new means of production and social practices, implies a new type of society that Manuel Castells Castells & Gustavo Cardoso (1996) called: Network Society. The important thing about this new era and society is that it is tremendously interconnected and thanks to new technologies of high practical performance and individual use such as smart cell phones, users can have access to information resources, opportunities and experiences even without material, legal, moral and ethical limits. <br><br>
            On the internet an ordinary user nowadays within his initial steps to surf the net has specific sites where to start, essentially search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc., and various social or interaction networks. Especially three can be highlight: professional social networks (like Linkedin), widespread networks (like Facebook, Twitter, Youtuve) and specialized networks (like Jstore) (see mind map). <br><br>

            <h3> Social networks and search engines are not the only platforms where the act of disinformation is carried out, since in the network other spaces may be more given to misinformation. Even the traditional media such as the press, radio and television have fostered disinformation in their eras and societies. In 1836 Great Moon Hoax was perhaps the first fake new in the history of the press, or the radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds in 1938 both in EE.UU. <br><br>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Research methodology</h2>
            <h3>We have decided to carry out a survey to carry out a study on what people think about misinformation on social networks.</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the mean age of the population  who made the survey?.</li>
                <li>Do you use social networks to see news?.</li>
                <li>What social network do you prefer to use to see news?.</li>
                <li>Do you know how to differentiate between an advertisement or fake news from real news?.</li>
                <li>Do you trust the veracity of the news you see, hear or read on the Internet and Social Networks?.</li>
                <li>What topic is your preference when looking for information on Social Networks?.</li>
                <li>Which do you feel are the most likely topic to develop through disinformation in the form of fake news?.</li>
                <li>Understanding that there are both traditional media (press, radio, TV) as well as Social Networks and the Internet. In which spaces do you feel there is more misinformation?.</li>
                <li>What traditional news media do you consume through their official portals in the social networks of these media?.</li>

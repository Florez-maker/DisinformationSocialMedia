            <h2 style="text-align:center">Introduction and Statement of the Problem</h2>
            <h3> The Internet has its starting point in the 60s with the objective to contribute with the arms race of the Cold War against de Soviet Union in which the race for space, the banking system and sciences and universities were the priorities.<br><br>
            However, the Internet did not have a significant impact on the broad masses until the creation of the first practical computer systems and the new generations of personal computers, which allowed access to the it for anyone.<br><br>
            In that way, the Internet has been a great tool for hyper connection between people, communication, research, and investigation, which has facilitating globalization in last decades. Unfortunately, the advantages were obscured by the mismanagement of it that dehumanizes humanity by reducing interactions to user stuff.<br> <br>
            Although it may not seem like it, one of the main purposes of social networks created at the end of the 90s, was not only about to connect people and their experiences, but also to reduce connections under anonymity. The problem came when the networks did not solve that problem, rather they increased it and gave it more dynamism.<br> <br>
            Is clear that the anonymity is a big problem, but it isn´t necessary to be anonymous to fall into another of the great problems of contemporaneity, the disinformation.  Curiously, at the beginning of social networks was not a source of disinformation but through time with the increasing amount of people and information identify false from real information has become complex.<br> <br>
            The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact that social networks have had on public opinion and its consequences. A social network that not only presents both anonymous users and verified subjects, but these may be interacting in a way that is negative for the construction of an objective and informed public opinion.<br> <br>
            Firstly, the incidence of information dissemination through networks and how it affects public opinion will be analyzed. This will be done by a brief documentary review comment and the data collected by a survey done on a small scale. Secondly, solutions will be shared to work in the fight against disinformation, on how to detect fake news and cultivate a digital or media literacy. Lastly, a short explanatory video will be presented to understand  better the ways of verifications that any user and person can do to spot fake news.<br> <br>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Status of the issue</h2>
            <h3> The internet is not a means of communication in itself. It is the metaspace in network where to enter you must first establish a connection, and as long as you are connected, it is possible to surf the net in a sea of possibilities, tools, knowledge, relationships, etc. Interestingly, humans have always sought to create faster and more efficient communication networks. For the romans and the incas, having consolidated themselves as empires on both continents, their leaders understood the need for communication and its immediacy for the strength of their society. That is why in different periods of time, both cultures and societies shared the same communication network: the chains of runners, who had to undertake a path to deliver important correspondence (sometimes they were killed for this work). From the Silk Road to transatlantic trips made on ships that, among other things, transported courier from Europe to the New World. Even until the middle of the twentieth century the transport of messengers and various news was through material means such as trains or ships. Which wasn't exactly immediate. The messaging had the real need to become more instantaneous due to the influence that the logic of a warrior had in the two World Wars. <br><br>
            The birth of the internet has already been mentioned, but the impact it has had on society, its development and its effect that catapulted a total globalization (started in 1492) began in the 90's. In that period, Internet connectivity became more widespread in the world and countries, and various platforms created on the Internet saw in this metaspacel tool the possibility of carrying dot .com business models. Many internet domains have been created for this purpose. Although for the interest of this essay, social networks are part of the new technologies of mass use and communication, that contribute to the demonstration of our purpose. <br><br>
            It is said that the entry of the internet into world culture not only meant a third industrial revolution but has shaped a new kind of moment for humanity, the Digital Age. A new temporality, with new means of production and social practices, implies a new type of society that Manuel Castells Castells & Gustavo Cardoso (1996) called: Network Society. The important thing about this new era and society is that it is tremendously interconnected and thanks to new technologies of high practical performance and individual use such as smart cell phones, users can have access to information resources, opportunities and experiences even without material, legal, moral and ethical limits. <br><br>
            On the internet an ordinary user nowadays within his initial steps to surf the net has specific sites where to start, essentially search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc., and various social or interaction networks. Especially three can be highlight: professional social networks (like Linkedin), widespread networks (like Facebook, Twitter, Youtuve) and specialized networks (like Jstore) (see mind map). <br><br>

            <h3> Social networks and search engines are not the only platforms where the act of disinformation is carried out, since in the network other spaces may be more given to misinformation. Even the traditional media such as the press, radio and television have fostered disinformation in their eras and societies. In 1836 Great Moon Hoax was perhaps the first fake new in the history of the press, or the radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds in 1938 both in EE.UU. <br><br>

            <h3>
              The fact that disinformation is a phenomenon with historical significance makes it possible to ask the question about: Whether the information media where people and currently users have searched and are looking for information, are means given to inform from the objectivity and informative veracity? The truth is that it is difficult to answer this question since the totally objective and truthful information of reality is a question that would be even philosophic. Therefore, even questioning a really informed public opinion about what is happening in their reality is very complex. <br><br>
              Studying public opinion and its construction is not a simple topic. In fact, the scales of opinion that the public generates or consumes must first be defined, and understand what climate of opinion results, and this process generates an interdependence between the various opinions that exist. In simple terms, public opinion can arise organically from a conversation, or it can be artificial when this opinion is transmitted by a means of communication. Social networks within its role as a new technology where hyperinteractions, relationships and communications occur, is the contemporary medium where a new style of public opinion arises both organically and artificially but the border between both is porous and more if misinformation spreads.<br><br>
             Misinformation on social networks can be produced as a content prepared by anyone, -even by an Artificial Intelligence-, which results in a large part of the climate of opinion within social networks being a lie. Among that information that could be real are fake news that can be prepared according to any topic: health, environment, politics, entertainment, etc... If that happens, users and people behind the screens continue to consume the content of fake news without questioning or contrasting it. So, we must expect that there is a climate of opinion at least online with levels of disinformation never seen before.<br><br>
             Before the internet, the issue of opinion climates and disinformation was just as complex, except that it was only at the end of the twentieth century that this phenomenon began to be studied. Perhaps there has never been a climate of opinion formed in objectivity and truthfulness. Neither an organic climate given the gossip, or an artificial climate generated by the biased information of the traditional mass media. Perhaps currently on the Internet and social networks these historical phenomena have seen an increase. This means that nowadays the existence of an objective public opinion is difficult to identify.<br><br>
             Given that the problem posed by the Internet and social networks has already been presented within its incidence for the creation of a public opinion and its impact on the climate of opinion if it is subject to the phenomenon of disinformation, increased in this modernity of the digital age and the networked society. <br><br>
             The quantitative results of surveys conducted on a small focus group are presented below. We present this since without current quantitative data we could not develop the following hypotheses: People are aware of disinformation on the internet regardless of their age, people know how to identify disinformation and fake news, people know in general which topics are more given to disinformation. If the data are consistent with our ideas, we can continue to argue that despite the high rates of misinformation on the internet and social networks, users openly seek objective and truthful information according to their contexts. This means that the Internet is working to improve the digital and media literacy of users.<br><br>
            </h3>
            <h2 style="text-align:center">Research methodology and Results</h2>
            <h3>We have decided to carry out a survey to carry out a study on what people think about misinformation on social networks.</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the mean age of the population  who made the survey?.</li>
                <li>Do you use social networks to see news?.</li>
                <li>What social network do you prefer to use to see news?.</li>
                <li>Do you know how to differentiate between an advertisement or fake news from real news?.</li>
                <li>Do you trust the veracity of the news you see, hear or read on the Internet and Social Networks?.</li>
                <li>What topic is your preference when looking for information on Social Networks?.</li>
                <li>Which do you feel are the most likely topic to develop through disinformation in the form of fake news?.</li>
                <li>Understanding that there are both traditional media (press, radio, TV) as well as Social Networks and the Internet. In which spaces do you feel there is more misinformation?.</li>
                <li>What traditional news media do you consume through their official portals in the social networks of these media?.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>       
            <h3>Previously, the Theoretical background was explained, which is an important part of the methodology, but this wouldn´t be complete without the quantitative results collected through surveys conducted to a small focus group of twenty-three people. The surveys were made through a virtual format in which people of different ages participated in a range between 13 and 59 (see graph 1). This is given that access to the internet and social networks begins at an early age. No data were obtained from people over 60 years of age, although all people, regardless of their age, are theoretically exposed to disinformation and fake news.</h3>

            <h3>Among the 23 people surveyed, around 22 people (96%) indicated that they use social networks to watch news and get informed. There is one person (4%) who indicated not having this habit, and this being an outlier caused us interest so we reviewed his age range and he is a female person in the age range between 13 and 20 years. The above is not relatively important but indicates a person identified as outside the constant of the analyzed collective (see graph 2). </h3>

            <h3>Regarding which social networks people in this group prefer to read or watch news, we found that the preferred one is Twitter with 14 votes. Facebook and Instagram are next with 10 votes for equal. Then there are YouTube (7 votes) and Tiktok (3 votes), two social networks where the particularity of the content format is that it must be mainly in video, the first allows short and extensive (up to hours) and the second short (3 minutes). A person marked that he uses another social network, this data was analyzed individually and threw a male person who indicated in the previous question that he does use social networks to see news, however we do not have the data of which one he uses (see graph 3).</h3>

            <h3>These data are just as interesting from the perspective of the economic interest of the social network. From traditional media to these new technologies, whoever has the means to disseminate information has the means to control it, promote it or censor it. From that simple empirically proven aspect, it can be determined that any mass media can obtain objectivity since it serves to economic interests. Twitter is a unique company that competes against the META holding group, owner of technologies such as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp (three of the largest hyperinformation flow networks). Youtube is a company that started as a unique company but now has a diverse range of products as well as is currently part of the holding group Alphabet, Inc. (which owns the largest search engine, Google, and Andriod operating systems). The previous 4 social networks are of American origin and have an affinity with the interests of this State although they operate all over the world. However, Tik tok is a relatively new social network with particularities such as great popularity and being of Chinese origin. Although all these companies want to deny it, there is a danger that behind the management of these companies are the governments of both countries and manage to influence the climates of opinion through censorship not only of their countries but of others</h3>

            <h3>The graph 4 leads to the following interesting results: 9 people (39,1%) consider that they know how to differentiate between an advertisement or fake news from a real news, only one person (4,3%) considers that he doesn´t know how to differentiate that. However, 13 people feel doubtful because they don´t know how to differentiate well between the effects of disinformation and the identification of true and objective news (56,5%). The conclusions and recommendations at the end of this work can help those who feel that doubt.</h3>

            <h3> Regarding the confidence in the veracity of the news that is on the Internet, especially in Social Networks, we have the following data: 2 people (8,7%) indicated that they do trust, 4 people (21,7%) did not agree and 16 people (69,6%) indicated that they feel doubtful about it (see graph 5).</h3>

            <h3> Graphs 6 and 7 present data that should be viewed together. Graph 6 indicates which topics people prefer to be informed about, and they mainly search for topics on politics, culture and entertainment and leisure. And graph 7 indicates people's perception of the issues most likely to develop through disinformation in the form of fake news and mainly consider that politics is very susceptible to the phenomenon of disinformation. Interesting is that they then consider the issues related to health subject to disinformation and also the issues of entertainment and leisure.</h3>

            <h3> The graph 8 presents data that are consistent with what is exposed in the state of the issue. The question about in which spaces do you feel that there is more disinformation? In the traditional media or in the new technologies such as social networks? It presented expected results since 5 people (21,7%) indicated that disinformation is higher in traditional media, 3 people (13%) indicated that it is higher in social networks, however, 16 people (65,2%) indicated that there is a kind of complement between both effects of disinformation in both spaces that affects the objectivity and veracity of public opinion in general.</h3>

            <h2> style="text-align:center">Conclusions</h2>
            <h3>
            Throughout this work, an effort has been developed in synthesis to understand the impact that the Internet has had on society and the platforms that this meta-space offers within its multiple tools. One of these new technologies are social networks, which differ according to the intention and use that the user can give. Currently the generalized social networks are those larger, more technified and popular networks, and that have exhibited in the networked culture and society a change in the construction of public opinion climates, which until the year 2000 were the traditional media that articulated an artificial opinion climate. Both the traditional mass media in the past and now the generalizing social networks haven´t been able to escape from being the spaces where the phenomena of disinformation are created, promoted and made visible. Although this phenomenon has been constant regardless of the medium where the misinformation is transmitted, it cannot be denied that today this phenomenon is developing in a more uncontrolled and even normalized way. Therefore unpredictable and disastrous if what is sought is the construction of an objective and truthful public opinion.<br><br>
            In a few simple points as a recommendation, we present some steps to follow so that the person / user can, from their individuality, better identify when disinformation may be presenting itself on social networks (although the formula is suitable for any media). In the same way, at the end of this document, a video will be left mounted on how to spot a fake news. <br><br>
            The following are our recommendations to work from the individuality in the exercise of increasing our digital and media literacy and with this to have greater culture and awareness when consuming information in social networks or the internet in our quality of cyber users: 
            </h3>
            <ul>
            <li> Analyze information sources/accounts.</li>
            <li> Confirm data such as time, date, place and the autor.</li>
            <li> Identify other published news and its veracity.</li>
            <li> Check the information with other sources.</li>
            <li> Analyze the form and tonality in which the news or the information is announced.</li>
